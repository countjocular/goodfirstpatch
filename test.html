      <h1>Why Contribute to Open Source?</h1>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Open source lets you collaborate and learn from the best people in the
        field. You can learn everything from how to hack up a quick fun
        project to how to write software that ships to millions of people, you dont
        need a degree or to pass a series of quizical interviews, just some
        patience and knowhow (thats why we are here).
      </p>

      <h3>Power over your tools</h3>
      <p>
        Ever found a library that does 90% of what you need but misses some crucial
        functionality, ever had a particularly annoying bug in some project or
        application you use? By contributing to Open Source tools you get the
        power to fix these.
      </p>

      <h3>Pay it forward</h3>
      <p>
        You very likely use thousands of Open Source projects every time you touch
        your computer, from your web browser, your favourite web framework to
        the libraries used to build your operating system. By collaborating on
        Open Source projects we can share the effort we put into constantly
        improving technology and not rewriting low level libraries, lets
        stand on the shoulders of giants.
      </p>

      <h1>Choosing a Patch</h1>
      <p>
        So you are ready to make your first patch, great! The first thing to do
        is pick your project, we have a list of open bugs that authors
        have hand picked to be ideal for first time contributions, if you have
        something on your mind that isnt on the list thats even better.
      </p>

      <p>
        Look at the project history, the mailing list and previous code submissions.
        Ideally the project will have recent activity and recent mailing list
        and code submissions that have been addressed by a maintainer. If you see
        a lot of unanswered submissions then its less likely your submission will
        be addressed
      </p>

      <p>
        Pick an issue, the best issues for first patches are bug fixes or minor
        feature enhancements, it should be easy to understand both what the problem
        is and how it should be fixed. Things like significant new features or
        refactorings are generally not the best candidates. Starting with a small
        bug lets you get familiar with the project, its workflow and structure and
        move on to bigger changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do some research, has the thing you want to work on have an open issue? is
        there anyone already working on it?
      </p>

      <p>
        Get in touch, open a bug or comment on one to say you plan on working on it,
        possibly describe what your plan is, the maintainer may have ideas or
        suggestions. A lot of projects have an irc channel, very often #projectname
        on irc.freenode.net, try to find this and introduce yourself, its a great
        place to ask some basic setup questions that may not be addressed in the
        documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Report any problems you had getting started, this is where you have the
        advantage as a new contributor, the committers on the project have forgotten
        how hard it was to get started and you can help document and fix the problems
        you had for future contributors.
      </p>
