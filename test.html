      <h1>Why Contribute to Open Source?</h1>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Open source lets you collaborate and learn from the best people in the
        field. You can learn everything from how to hack up a quick fun
        project to how to write software that ships to millions of people, you dont
        need a degree or to pass a series of quizical interviews, just some
        patience and knowhow (thats why we are here).
      </p>

      <h3>Power over your tools</h3>
      <p>
        Ever found a library that does 90% of what you need but misses some crucial
        functionality, ever had a particularly annoying bug in some project or
        application you use? By contributing to Open Source tools you get the
        power to fix these.
      </p>

      <h3>Pay it forward</h3>
      <p>
        You very likely use thousands of Open Source projects every time you touch
        your computer, from your web browser, your favourite web framework to
        the libraries used to build your operating system. By collaborating on
        Open Source projects we can share the effort we put into constantly
        improving technology and not rewriting low level libraries, lets
        stand on the shoulders of giants.
      </p>

      <h1>Choosing a Patch</h1>
      <p>
        So you are ready to make your first patch, great! The first thing to do
        is pick your project, we have a list of open bugs that authors
        have hand picked to be ideal for first time contributions, if you have
        something on your mind that isnt on the list thats even better.
      </p>

      <p>
        Look at the project history, the mailing list and previous code submissions.
        Ideally the project will have recent activity and recent mailing list
        and code submissions that have been addressed by a maintainer. If you see
        a lot of unanswered submissions then its less likely your submission will
        be addressed
      </p>

      <p>
        Pick an issue, the best issues for first patches are bug fixes or minor
        feature enhancements, it should be easy to understand both what the problem
        is and how it should be fixed. Things like significant new features or
        refactorings are generally not the best candidates. Starting with a small
        bug lets you get familiar with the project, its workflow and structure and
        move on to bigger changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do some research, has the thing you want to work on have an open issue? is
        there anyone already working on it?
      </p>

      <p>
        Get in touch, open a bug or comment on one to say you plan on working on it,
        possibly describe what your plan is, the maintainer may have ideas or
        suggestions. A lot of projects have an irc channel, very often #projectname
        on irc.freenode.net, try to find this and introduce yourself, its a great
        place to ask some basic setup questions that may not be addressed in the
        documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Report any problems you had getting started, this is where you have the
        advantage as a new contributor, the committers on the project have forgotten
        how hard it was to get started and you can help document and fix the problems
        you had for future contributors.
      </p>

      <h1>Your first patch</h1>

      <p>
        Dont worry about asking questions, if you get stuck on setting the project
        up or with your patch, feel free to ask on IRC / via issue or the mailing
        list.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you are happy with your patch, get it ready for submission, projects
        should have guidelines (check for a README or CONTRIBUTORS file) or
        look for previous submissions and follow their lead. Try to make sure
        you have followed existing code styles etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Submit your patch! Now its time to wait, give the author some time to respond,
        if you havent seen a response within 2 days then feel free to ping a maintainer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Address follow ups, often a maintainer will come back with small issues in
        code style, sometimes these can seem minor however they can be important
        for consistency.
      </p>

      <h1>So you have an Open Source Project?</h1>
      <p>
        The advice so far has been for first time contributors, here is some for
        project authors
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly describe your project
      </p>
      <p>
        Describe in clear steps how to set up a development environment, this is one
        of the biggest barriers to contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Respond to emails / issues / pull requests, even if it looks like someone
        is on the right track and doesnt need input, it will help to hear confirmation.
        If you do not want to accept a patch then state why and close the issue, this
        is always hard as it feels like you are wasting someones time / rejecting their
        work, however leaving contributions in purgatory is much worse.
